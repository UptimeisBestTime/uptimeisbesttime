IT Professional | Cloud And Network Engineer | Cybersec Enthusiast 

I'm a future Cloud Engineer specialized in Microsoft Azure Solutions turning cloud chaos into beautifully orchestrated infrastructure. 🌤️ By day, I wrangle Azure Bicep files and build self-service platforms. By night, I research and learn heavily about Cloud, Kubernetes, and AI and Cybersecurity.

🚀 What I'm Up To

    🔧Building foundational cloud skills by provisioning secure, scalable infrastructure (AKS) and Terraform/Bicep.
    📊 Mastering cloud health and monitoring using Azure Monitor and custom dashboards in Log Analytics to ensure peak performance and security.
    🤖 Exploring cutting-edge services including Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, and building out MLOps  pipelines within Azure Machine Learning.
    🎥 Teaching Cloud Networking  & Kubernetes concepts through bite-sized tutorials
    ☕ Drinking coffee while debugging PowerShell/Azure CLI scripts (it's the first step to automation!).

💼 Experience Highlights

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Designed and deployed a three-tier cloud environment (VPC/VNet, Web Server, Database) using Terraform to demonstrate proficiency in repeatable infrastructure provisioning.

Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): Created automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to build a Docker container, store it in a container registry (e.g., ECR/ACR), and automatically deploy it to a Minikube/AKS environment using a Helm chart.

Container Orchestration: Built a microservice application and managed its deployment, scaling, and networking using a personal Kubernetes cluster, implementing a GitOps workflow with FluxCD for state management.

Observability: Integrated Grafana and Prometheus into a cloud application stack to collect and visualize application metrics, setting up active alerting rules to simulate incident response readiness.

🛠️ My Tech Stack
Cloud & Infrastructure:

    Azure: Microsoft's cloud computing platform (equivalent to GCP/AWS).
    Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Managed Kubernetes service (equivalent to Kubernetes).
    Azure Container Instances (ACI) / Azure App Service Containers: Ways to run containers (equivalent to Docker).
    Azure Container Registry (ACR): Private Docker container registry (often used with AKS).
    Leveraging  Azure Arc for GitOps configuration management.
    
Emerging Tech: MLOps, AI Agents, Model Context Protocol
🌎 Beyond the Terminal
When I'm not shipping infrastructure or tinkering with the latest tech , I enjoy fishing and woodworking!
